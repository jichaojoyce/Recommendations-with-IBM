## Description

This Project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight.
The initial dataset contains disaster related categories and messages. 
This project is aim to classify the disaster related messages to different group. Writen in python.

The Project contains three folders:

1. 'data' folder contains the excel data and ETL Pipeline. The ETL pipeline is to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper databse structure
2. 'models' folder contains Machine Learning Pipeline. The ML pipeline used GridSearchCV to train the model to category messages.
3. 'app' folder is to show model results in a html web.

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/disease.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/disease.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
